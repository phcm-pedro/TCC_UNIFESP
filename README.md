Myocardial infarction (MI) and coronary artery disease (CAD) rank among the most financially burdensome conditions for public healthcare systems such as Brazil’s Unified Health System (SUS). Preventing these conditions often relies on diagnostic procedures such as angiography, which are not only expensive but also scarcely accessible to low-income individuals. It is within this context that numerous studies have sought to employ machine learning strategies to enhance automated recognition of patients at risk of MI and CAD. Here we aim to investigate the feasibility of using tree-based algorithms to classify and interpret general health data of patients potentially at risk of cardiovascular diseases. We tested three algorithms based on decision trees using a database from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, in terms of both accuracy and detection of true positives, suggesting that such algorithms - especially when combined with an interpretability analysis of risk factors – hold promise to be employed in the development of low-cost strategies to prevent cardiovascular diseases.
